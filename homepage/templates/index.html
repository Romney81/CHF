              The Foundation coordinates and helps to establish community groups to encourage the reading and discussion of America's historical documents. For example, the Federalist Papers and the Anti-federalist Papers were publications that made the argument for and against the adoption of America's current constitution. The study and discussion of these documents can help Americans today understand the issues that were of most concern to our founding generation regarding the establishment of a strong federal government. These documents were written in a language style that is foreign to most contemporary readers. By providing recommended reading schedules, discussion questions, and materials to help modern readers read and grasp federal-period writings, the Foundation hopes to encourage small, community-based groups to undertake independent study of such founding documents. These discussion groups will be conducted year-round by volunteers and held in homes or community meeting places throughout the nation.

              The Foundation sponsors lectures, seminars and workshops about the values, culture, skills, and history of America's founding era. Such events may be coordinated with universities and other educationally-focused organizations to educate adults about the sacrifices that early Americans made to provide today's population with the freedoms we enjoy. These events  seek to inspire individuals to engage in community-based educational activities to increase exposure an awareness of the history surrounding America's founding. Lectures, seminars and workshops are coordinated and presented year-round by Foundation volunteers. Depending on the venue, they are offered either free of charge or for a fee.
